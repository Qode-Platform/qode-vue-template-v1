# Built by .github/workflows/deploy.yml (context ., file Dockerfile) and pushed
# to Artifact Registry. Adapted from the fleet's static stack pack.
#
# Deviations from the pack, and why:
#   - `npm install` when no lockfile is committed; the pack assumes `npm ci`,
#     which fails outright without one.
#   - node:22, not the pack's node:20: Astro requires >=22.12 and Nuxt's build
#     crashes on 20 (trustedFunctions.difference is not a function).
