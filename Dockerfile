# Built by .github/workflows/deploy.yml (context ., file Dockerfile) and pushed
# to Artifact Registry. Adapted from the fleet's static stack pack.
#
# Deviations from the pack, and why:
#   - `npm install` when no lockfile is committed; the pack assumes `npm ci`,
#     which fails outright without one.
#
# BASE_PATH is NOT baked in: it is per-agent and only known at run time, so the
# image serves at the host root under k8s and the agent's /direct/<id>:<port>
# run supplies its own prefix.
